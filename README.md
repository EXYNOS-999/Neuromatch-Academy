### Welcome to the Neuromatch Academy Epistemological Directory!
Neuromatch Academy (NMA), July 13-31 (2020)  

This is a place to explore topics and ideas surrounding the NMA course prep and content. In [Epistemological Directories (ED)](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/tree/master/Epistemological%20Directory), you will find a series of topical stubs, which you can contribute to with infographics, reference lists, notes and points to revisit, or even slideshows! Please make sure that images are not copyrighted, and a [code of conduct](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) is in force (which includes rules on plagiarism).

Contributions can be made via issues, pull requests, or submitted via [e-mail](mailto:Orthogonal-Lab@outlook.com). You can also annotate this README using [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) (using their Chrome plug-in or bookmarklet). For text-based pull requests, you should create .md files written in Markdown ([click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXlZ2tEndNPOO1vmL4_MoAt-Tqjd0dUU/view?usp=sharing) for a quick tutorial).

Join our [discussion group](https://representational-brains-phenotypes.weebly.com/neuromatch-academy.html)! We will also be collaborating in groups using this repository, [OREL Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T48BNG3A5/C015B5V5TEH), and [OREL Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/orthogonal_lab).

Don't forget to go through the preparatory materials! While the curriculum does not require a high degree of knowledge in Neuroscience or Computational thinking, you should brush up on the basics.
