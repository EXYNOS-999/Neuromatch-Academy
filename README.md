Join our [discussion group](https://representational-brains-phenotypes.weebly.com/neuromatch-academy.html)! We will also be collaborating in groups using this repository, [OREL Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T48BNG3A5/C015B5V5TEH), and [OREL Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/orthogonal_lab).

Don't forget to go through the preparatory materials! While the curriculum does not require a high degree of knowledge in Neuroscience or Computational thinking, you should brush up on the basics.
