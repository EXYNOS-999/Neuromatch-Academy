1. Explore the complexities of feedback (e.g. sensorimotor) loops through the use of simulated agents exhibiting different degrees of representation (on a continuum from representation-free to representation-rich). Implementation might include Bayesian models, agent-based models, or something as simple as a pendulum.

2. Using [this behavioral dataset](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.909838v2.full), evaluate how performance degrades by injecting different types and amounts of noise into the behavioral signal. Noise from different distributions (Gaussian, 1/f) can be recombined with the behavioral signal, or be introduced as a masking function (additive, multiplicative). The idea would be to understand the role of noise in data, and how it is not always something to be ignored.
